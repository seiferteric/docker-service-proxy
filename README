This docker image allows you to run your container in privleged mode with docker 1.12 swarm serves by using a "proxy" container to run your actual command and proxy tcp requests back to the service container. 

Because dcoker 1.12 swarm services does not currently allow you to run your services with cap-add or privileged or net=host, this is a workaround to do that. 


EXAMPLE:

docker run -it -e PROXY_PORTS="80 443" -e PROXY_CMD="sleep 600" -e PROXY_DST="google.com" -v /var/run:/var/run docker-proxy /proxy.sh


Where PROXY_CMD is the actual command you want to run
